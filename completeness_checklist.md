# completeness checklist

verification that all requirements from the original specification have been implemented.

## core requirements

### mcp server
- [x] auto-discovers sdk tools (modules/classes/methods/functions)
- [x] exposes tools via mcp with json-serializable request/response schemas
- [x] executes calls with auth, timeouts, retries, and error shaping
- [x] json-rpc 2.0 protocol over stdio

### generalization layer
- [x] reflection over modules/classes/methods to generate tool catalog
- [x] configurable allowlist/denylist by dotted path/glob
- [x] pluggable auth providers chosen by sdk family
- [x] works with arbitrary sdks without code changes

### llm-assisted enhancements
- [x] improve tool names/descriptions
- [x] infer/normalize pydantic schemas from signatures/docstrings/type hints
- [x] propose enums/defaults
- [x] generate usage examples and guardrails text

### pagination/streaming support
- [x] detect common patterns (page, per_page, next_token, iterators)
- [x] expose mcp-friendly controls (limit, cursor)
- [x] heuristics to detect list/iterator/pager objects
- [x] option to auto-iterate up to max_items
- [x] single-page and multi-page collection modes

### safety layer
- [x] default-deny destructive/mutating operations
- [x] opt-in via config (allow_dangerous)
- [x] redaction of secrets in logs
- [x] rate limits/backoffs
- [x] dry-run option for dangerous operations

### authentication
- [x] generic api key (env header)
- [x] cloud providers (aws/gcp/azure default creds)
- [x] kubernetes (kubeconfig/in-cluster)
- [x] github token
- [x] simple per-sdk mapping rules in config

### schema generation
- [x] extract from inspect.signature, type hints, docstrings
- [x] fall back to llm to fill gaps
- [x] emit pydantic models
- [x] serialize to json schema for mcp

### execution engine
- [x] map json args → python call (type coercion)
- [x] timeouts
- [x] retries on transient errors with exponential backoff
- [x] cancellation support
- [x] standardized error payloads (code/message/hint/origin)
- [x] async function support

## additional features

### performance
- [x] in-memory caching with ttl
- [x] cache statistics and hit rate tracking
- [x] configurable cache settings

### reliability
- [x] rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- [x] per-tool rate limits
- [x] retry logic with smart error detection

### observability
- [x] structured json logging
- [x] configurable log levels
- [x] metrics collection (counters, timers, gauges)
- [x] server info endpoint with statistics
- [x] uptime tracking

### security
- [x] input validation (json-rpc format, tool names, arguments)
- [x] string sanitization
- [x] secret redaction in responses
- [x] allowlist/denylist with glob patterns
- [x] dry-run mode for testing

## documentation

- [x] quickstart (install, env, run)
- [x] "add a new sdk" guide
- [x] mcp transcript examples (tools/list, tools/call)
- [x] demo targets showing real sdks
- [x] comprehensive configuration guide
- [x] examples for all major features
- [x] architecture overview
- [x] production deployment notes

## tests

### unit tests
- [x] reflection → schema
- [x] arg coercion
- [x] error shaping
- [x] pagination adapters
- [x] caching
- [x] rate limiting
- [x] validation
- [x] filtering
- [x] dry-run
- [x] safety checks

### integration tests
- [x] auth integration

### smoke tests
- [x] basic server lifecycle
- [x] tools/list endpoint
- [x] tools/call endpoint
- [x] server/info endpoint
- [x] multiple sdks
- [x] filtering
- [x] caching behavior
- [x] validation

### test infrastructure
- [x] comprehensive test runner
- [x] all tests passing
- [x] no external dependencies required for tests

## non-functional requirements

- [x] works with arbitrary sdks by changing only configuration
- [x] clear logs (no secrets)
- [x] typed code
- [x] small modules
- [x] readable errors
- [x] one-line run command
- [x] deterministic demos

## demo and examples

- [x] modular architecture
- [x] clean separation of concerns
- [x] comprehensive error handling
- [x] production-ready code quality

## status

**100% complete** - all requirements from the original specification have been fully implemented and tested.

the project is production-ready and can be deployed immediately for real-world use cases.
